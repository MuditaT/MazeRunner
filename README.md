# MazeRunner
This project has been implemented in two parts.
* I have generated simple maps/mazes, and implemented basic search algorithms (BFS,DFS,A* with euclidean distance and A* with Manhattan distance) to find paths from the start to the goal.I have used probability measure to determine the density of walls/blocks in the maze by providing a text box in the GUI.
* I have utilized local search algorithm- Genetic algorithm to construct and discover mazes that will take particularly more time to solve.
